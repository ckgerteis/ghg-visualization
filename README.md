# The Other Greenhouse Gases

An interactive visualization exploring methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) — the accelerating crisis beyond CO₂.

## Live Demo

Once deployed, your site will be available at: `https://[your-username].github.io/ghg-visualization/`

## Features

- **The Three Gases**: Compare percentage increases of CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O since pre-industrial times
- **Methane Crisis**: Deep dive into the post-2007 methane surge
- **N₂O Problem**: The fertilizer-driven nitrous oxide rise
- **Warming Power**: Global Warming Potential comparisons (20-year vs 100-year)
- **Emission Sources**: Where methane and N₂O come from
- **Agriculture Link**: How food production drives these emissions
- **Climate Impact**: Radiative forcing breakdown
