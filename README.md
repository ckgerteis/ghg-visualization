# The Other Greenhouse Gases

An interactive visualization exploring methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) — the accelerating crisis beyond CO₂.

## Pages

### Main Visualization (`/`)
Interactive exploration of greenhouse gas trends and their climate impact:

- **The Three Gases**: Compare percentage increases of CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O since pre-industrial times
- **Methane Crisis**: Deep dive into the post-2007 methane surge
- **N₂O Problem**: The fertilizer-driven nitrous oxide rise
- **Warming Power**: Global Warming Potential comparisons (20-year vs 100-year)
- **Emission Sources**: Where methane and N₂O come from
- **Agriculture Link**: How food production drives these emissions
- **Climate Impact**: Radiative forcing breakdown

### Maritime Corridors (`/maritime-corridor.html`)
Well-to-Wake and Well-to-Wire scenario explorer for maritime fuel pathways:

- **Boundary Analysis**: Compare Tank-to-Wake (TTW), Well-to-Wake (WTW), and Well-to-Wire (WTW→Wire) boundaries
- **Break-Even Heatmap**: Interactive visualization showing when LNG becomes competitive with coal power
- **Stage Breakdown**: Detailed GHG emissions by fuel cycle stage (upstream, shipping, combustion, power plant)
- **Scenario Controls**: Adjust key parameters like methane slip, upstream leakage, GWP horizon, and corridor distance
- **Multiple Corridors**: Pre-configured routes including Qatar→South Korea, US Gulf→Japan, and Australia→China
